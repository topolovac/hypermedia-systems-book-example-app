# hypermedia-systems-book-example-app

Repo containing example contacts application progress from hypermedia systems book.

Book can be found [here](https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/).

In book Python is used as programming language but I chose Golang with [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) with purpose of practicing Go.

## Run locally

Run app with: `make`

Hot reload mode with: `make hot`

## TODO LIST:

- basic functionality from book
- add flash message with context
- refactor everything by LetsGo book style (optional)
- add tailwind and some style (optional)
